To reduce the workload, the system will be developed as a Command Line Interface (CLI) application. GUI implementation is optional and will not carry any bonus marks, as the focus is on Object-Oriented Design and Programming (OODP).

The sample data file for user list is given in excel in assignment folder. You can
• Use them directly,
• Or copy the content to text file if you plan to read from text file,
• Or make your own data files.

But No database application (e.g. MySQL, MS Access, etc) is to be used.
No JSON or XML is to be used.
